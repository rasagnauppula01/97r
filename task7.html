    <p>HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.</p>
    <pre>
            Html stands on hyper text mark-up language.
	    HTML is used to create web pages and web applications.
	    HTML describes the structure of the web page.
	    HTML is widely used language on the web.
	    We can create a static website by HTML only.

    <P>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.</P>
    <pre>
        Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
        CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. 
        It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. 
        In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.

        While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

            Selector: A selector in CSS is used to target and select specific HTML elements to apply styles to.
            Declaration: A declaration in CSS is a combination of a property and its corresponding value.
            Selector -- h1
            Declaration -- {color:blue;font size:12px;} 
            The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
            The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
