            About:

            The plant is native to southern Europe and has a fascinating history.

            Alchemists allegedly thought this water to be the purest available, and they used it in their attempts to turn various metals into gold.

            and you’ll still commonly find florists using them in their designs under their scientific moniker, dianthus.
